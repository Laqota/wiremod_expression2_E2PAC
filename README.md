# wiremod_expression2_E2PAC
A Very, and I mean Very basic Expression2 Addon for Wiremod.

It's specifically for Server Owners to disable ConCMD but still allow PAC3 Events to be ran.
# Why though?
ConCMD is abusable. Well, it's not really abusable to the sake that it can ruin or shutdown a server and all that. ConCMD runs on the client and uses the clients console, not the servers. But if there are no staff or persons of power on the server someone can simply run a tick event and spam "concmd("say bruh this server stinks")". So most server owners of sandbox or DarkRP servers disable ConCMD. 

This is very similar to ConCMD but it just only fires PAC3 events, ONLY. This cannot be abused since everything is already possible inside their own console. You as a server owner is responsible to ensure people don't crash your server using PAC.
